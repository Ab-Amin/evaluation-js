## Does CookieConsent store consent records?

CookieConsent is a client-side only solution and therefore cannot access or store any type of data on the server.

You will either have to implement your own API and database or switch entirely to a more mainstream solution.

## How can I block iframes?

You can block iframes using [iframemanager](https://github.com/orestbida/iframemanager), a small plugin designed specifically for this task.
